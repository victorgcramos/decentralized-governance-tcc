# Schelling Segregation Model
This is an implementation of Schelling Segregation model in **python**.

## Setup

**You must have Python3.6 installed in order to run this simulation**

Clone this repo and run the simulation:
```bash
python3 schelling.py
```

Results should be stored on `/images/temp`. If the file has `...-before.png`, it means that the image is the first state of the simulation, and `...-after.png` means that the image is the final result after `n_of_iterations` iterations.
