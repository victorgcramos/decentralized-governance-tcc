# A basic definition of Sympol, a simplified political system

***Abstract - The current political system is complex and demands many features to keep working and not collapse. In this article, we are going to see the definition of a simplified political system, named Sympol, which  the basis for the article's definitions of people, government and representativeness.***

## Introduction

The idea of our work is to study different forms of representativeness regarding the principles of political representation.

### The political system

Firstly, the definition of **political system** is required to follow our definitions.

This schema above describes a simplified political system, named **Sympol**, whose main actors are **people** and **the Government**.

#### People
People, *a.k.a citizens*, are entities in which Sympol bases itself on. The idea of politics, [described by Aristotle](http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-pol/)[[1]](https://github.com/victorgcramos/tcc-unb/blob/master/definitions.md#bibliography), is the management of people's lives, to ensure peace and well-being of the population.

The leading roles of people, in Sympol, are:
- Pay taxes and comply with the laws;
- Vote and decide which people can be representatives;
- Enjoy public goods and express **opinion** about what happens in their lives.

> The Opinion, in Sympol, can only be expressed as positive or negative (like/dislike). Each Like means that the person agrees with the situation, and dislike means that the person disagrees with the situation.

#### The Government
The Government is a composition of people that were elected, and have the power to decide on social, economic, and political causes.

Sympol has a divided power according to [Montesquieu's definition of *separation of power*](http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/montesquieu-complete-works-vol-1-the-spirit-of-laws#lf0171-01_label_786) [[2]](https://github.com/victorgcramos/tcc-unb/blob/master/definitions.md#bibliography). The three powers on our system are **executive**, **legislative** and **judicial**.


- **Legislative**: the **Congress**, which roles are:

    - Pass bills
    - Taxing and spending power;
    - Regulate inter-state commerce;
    - Control the Federal treasure;
    - Have power to borrow money on the credit of the State.

- **Executive**: the President

    - Execute the instructions of Congress;
    - Veto the decisions of Congress.

- **Judicial**:

    - Determine which laws Congress intended to apply to any given case;
    - Ensure compliance with laws.

>  **[1] Money**: something generally accepted as a medium of exchange, a measure of value, or a means of payment; **[2] Tax**: a compulsory contribution to state revenue, levied by the government on workers' income and business profits, or added to the cost of some goods, services, and transactions [[3]](https://github.com/victorgcramos/tcc-unb/blob/master/definitions.md#bibliography); **[3] Federal treasure**: the money earned from taxes.

### The Voting System

The definition of *the process of choosing representatives* is critical for understanding the political system behind Sympol.

Sympol is a democratic system, which means every person can give opinions about what is happening in their lives regarding the decisions of the government by choosing a representative (voter) or being a representative (candidate).

The process of giving an opinion is called **election**. The following image can describe it:

![Voting System](https://github.com/victorgcramos/tcc-unb/blob/master/images/voting-system.png)


The consensus behind the decisions made by the population is the democratic one, which means if the **majority** stands for X, then X is approved. Therefore, the elected representative is chosen by the **higher number of votes**, which, in this case, is the Red candidate.

<!-- 
Let's take this quote as the starting point of this work:
> People do not feel represented -->

## Representativeness

According to the definitions above, the representativeness symbolizes the relationship between the representative and the voter. The process of having the opinion supported by the representative indicates that the voter *has representativeness*.

On our example above, it is possible to notice that the actual government (blue) does not satisfy the majority (more dislikes than likes). Hence, the population is not feeling represented by the government, so they vote for a new representative to improve the level of satisfaction.
