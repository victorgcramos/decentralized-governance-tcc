# A basic definition of Sympol, a simplified political system

***Abstract - The current political system is complex and demands a lot of features to keep working and not colapse. In this arcticle, we are going to see the definition of a simplified political system, named Sympol, which will be used as the basis for the arcticle's definitions of people, government and representativeness.***

## Introduction

The idea of our work is to study different forms of representativeness regarding the principles of political representation.

### The political system

Firstly, the definition of **political system** is required in order to follow our definitions.

This schema above describes a simplified political system, named **Sympol**, whose main actors are **people** and **the Government**.

#### People
People, *a.k.a citizens*, are entities in which Sympol is based. The idea of poltics, [described by Aristotle](http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-pol/), is the management of people's life, in order to ensure peace and well-being of the population.

The main roles of people, in Sympol are:
- Pay taxes and comply with the laws;
- Vote and decide which people can be elected as representatives;
- Enjoy public goods and express **opinion** about what happens on their lives.

> The Opinion, in Sympol, can only be expressed as positive or negative (like/dislike). Each Like means that the person agrees with the situation, and Dislike means that the person disagrees with the situation.

#### The Government
The Government, is a composition of people that were elected, and have power to decide on social, economical and political causes.

Sympol has a divided power according to [Montesquieu's definition of *separation of power*](http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/montesquieu-complete-works-vol-1-the-spirit-of-laws#lf0171-01_label_786). The three powers on our system are: **executive**, **legislative** and **judicial**.


- **Legislative**: the **Congress**, which roles are:

    - Pass bills
    - Taxing and spending power;
    - Regulate inter-state commerce;
    - Control the Federal Treasury;
    - Have power to borrow money on the credit of the State.

- **Executive**: the President

    - Execute the instructions of Congress;
    - Veto the decisions of the Congress.

- **Judicial**:

    - Determine which laws Congress intended to apply to any given case;
    - Ensure that laws are enforced.

>  **[1] Money**: something generally accepted as a medium of exchange, a measure of value, or a means of payment; **[2] Tax**: a compulsory contribution to state revenue, levied by the government on workers' income and business profits, or added to the cost of some goods, services, and transactions; **[3] Federal Treasury**: the money earned from taxes.

### The Voting System

The definition of *the process of choosing representatives* is critical for understanding the political system behind Sympol.

Sympol is democratic system, which means every person can give opinions about what is happening in their lives regarding the decisions of the government.

The process of giving opinion is called **election** and it can be described by the following image:
