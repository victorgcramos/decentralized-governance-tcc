# A basic definition of the Brazilian political system 

***Abstract - The current political system is complex and demands a lot of features to keep working and not colapse. In this arcticle, we are going to see the definition of a simplified political system, named Sympol, which will be used as the basis for the arcticle's definitions of people, State and representativeness.***

## Introduction

The idea of our work is to study different forms of representativeness regarding the principles of political representation.

### The political system

Firstly, the definition of **political system** is required in order to follow our definitions.

This schema above describes a simplified political system, named **Sympol**, whose main actors are **people** and **the State**.

#### People
People are entities in which Sympol is based. The idea of poltics, [described by Aristotle](http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-pol/), is the management of people's life, in order to ensure peace and well-being of the population.

The main roles of people, in Sympol are:
- Pay taxes and comply with the laws;
- Vote and decide which people can be elected as representatives;
- Enjoy public goods and express **opinion** about what happens on their life.

> The Opinion, in Sympol, can only be expressed as positive or negative (like/dislike). Each Like means that the person agrees with the situation, and Dislike means that the person disagrees with the situation.

#### The State
The State is a composition of people that were elected, and have power to decide on social, economical and political causes.

Sympol has a divided power according to [Montesquieu's definition of *separation of power*](http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/montesquieu-complete-works-vol-1-the-spirit-of-laws#lf0171-01_label_786). The three powers on our system are: **executive**, **legislative** and **judicial**.


- **Legislative**: the **Congress**, which roles are:

    - Pass bills
    - Taxing and spending power;
    - Regulate inter-state commerce;
    - Control the Federal Treasury;
    - Have power to borrow money on the credit of the State.

- **Executive**: the President

    - Execute the instructions of Congress;
    - Veto the decisions of the Congress.

- **Judicial**:

    - Determine which laws Congress intended to apply to any given case;
    - Ensure that laws are enforced.



Let's take this quote as the starting point of this work:
> People do not feel represented
