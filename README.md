# Decentralized Governance
Author: Victor Guedes (@victorgcramos)

***Abstract - the purpose of this project is to study the possibilities to implement decentralized governance in the current political systems***

## Motivation

Lawrence Lessig, professor at Harvard, presented that "[Our democracy no longer represents people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJy8vTu66tE)" on a TED Talk episode.

The main idea of Lessig's speech is that the current USA's electing system is not representing Americans. Primarily, he concludes that the electing system is an aggregate of a Citizen Election and a Money Election.

### Citizen Election
Citizens have the chance to choose the representative by a democratic process called "election." They choose one representative from a group of N candidates, which is responsible for representing the interests of the whole population.

A simplistic explanation of a citizen election, as exhibited here, can give a better idea of how does this process work.

### Money Election
The choice of candidates is not random. Firstly, the candidates divide themselves between groups, called political parties. We can assume that the candidates of the same political party have similar interests.

Each political party has its leaders, congressmen, influencers, and supporters. Let's understand what these four agents are:

![Political Party Pyramid](https://github.com/victorgcramos/decentralized-governance-tcc/blob/master/images/political-party-pyramid.png)

1. **Leaders**: people responsible for making decisions about the political party. They decide the rules and how to spend money earned from the _electoral funding_.
	> Electoral funding: a fraction of the national treasure destinated to fund the political parties on the election process 

2. **Congressmen**: people who have a sit on the Congress. They are responsible for addressing requests from their political party.

3. **Influencers**: people with high influence among the population. They have the power to persuade people and convince their followers to support their decisions.

4. **Supporters**: people who spread the political party's word, and donate money to help the party. They do not have active participation in the decision process.

These four groups mentioned above have the responsibility to select the candidates that would represent the population.


## Introduction

### The State of Art

Edmund Burke defines a representative democracy as an environment where people rely on representatives to make **decisions**. Each representative must represent a group of people that have common interests.

> "Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion, high respect; their business, unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfaction, to theirs" [1];

A group of candidates, whose only work is to **represent** the population, dispute the seats of the Congress by a process called **election**. People vote on those candidates to choose who represents them in the next years, and, posteriorly, the most voted candidates are elected.

### Larryland

Imagine a country called Larryland, which population is about 200 millions of people, and runs a unique representative democracy. The difference between Larryland's democracy from **The State of Art** (as mentioned before) is that only people from the families above can participate in the electoral process.

|  **Family**  | **% of the population** | **# of people** |
|:--------:|:-------------------:|:-----------:|
| Squid |         0.7%        |  1.599.174  |
|  Pocket  |        0.13%        |   271.701   |
|   Dread  |         0.7%        |  1.466.966  |

Each one of the three families mentioned above must choose one candidate to participate in the electoral process:

|  **Family**  | **Candidate Name** |
|:--------:|:-------------------:|
| Squid |       	Lewis        |
|  Pocket  |       Yair        |
|   Dread  |         Michael        |
